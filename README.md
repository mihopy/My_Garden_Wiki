# My_Garden_Wiki
A personal garden wiki built with Flask and SQLAlchemy, enhanced by the Perenual Plant API, to help organize, track, and explore information about the plants in my garden. 
This project allows me to store custom plant data while also fetching detailed information such as images and care instructions directly from the API, making plant management easier and more informative.
